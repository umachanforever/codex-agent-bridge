# Security model

`codex-agent-bridge` is a single-user, localhost-only process. The local bridge profile requires a client bearer key; the agent-service profile accepts requests without one. Managed keys can attribute requests when the web console is enabled, but they do not gate the agent-service profile. The optional web console has separate administrator authentication. None is a multi-tenant isolation boundary. The caller, proxy, and Codex child are expected to be trusted. See [web management](admin.md) for encryption, browser authentication and residual full-access-tool risks.

## Threat model and controls

| Threat | Control and residual risk |
| --- | --- |
| Non-loopback exposure | CLI host parsing accepts only `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, and `localhost`, then binds a normalized loopback address. Any other bind is a release-blocking defect. |
| DNS rebinding or hostile `Host` | Every route accepts only the exact loopback authorities `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]`, with an optional valid port. Missing, malformed, alias, and non-loopback authorities fail before routing. |
| Browser-originated requests | Any `Origin` header is rejected. Chat Completions additionally requires `Content-Type: application/json`, so browser-simple form posts fail closed. This intentionally does not provide CORS. |
| Oversized or slow input | Declared and streamed bodies share the configured byte limit. Request, tool, startup, and shutdown operations have deadlines; request and app-server ingress concurrency is bounded. |
| Local overload | The HTTP request pool rejects excess requests with 429 `overloaded` when a positive concurrency limit is configured. Docker defaults to 10,000 concurrent requests, a 128 MiB body limit, and a six-hour deadline. One active turn is permitted per Codex thread. SSE writes honor backpressure, and app-server ingress is bounded by event count and approximate bytes. |
| Log injection | Logs are one JSON object per line, so control characters in plaintext values remain JSON-escaped. Request logs record a parsed path rather than attacker-controlled query data. Logs are not redacted and must be treated as sensitive. |
| Executable substitution | The default executable comes from the exact `@openai/codex` runtime dependency. An explicit override is spawned without a shell and must report the pinned version before app-server starts. |
| Malicious tool names or arguments | Client function names use a restricted character set and length. Internal names are normalized. Arguments/results remain structured, are bounded where exposed diagnostically, and are never interpolated into a shell by the proxy. Codex built-in activity is observational and is not returned to the client for execution. Live filesystem fixtures stay inside an ephemeral workspace and verify the exact nonce written on disk. |
| Unintended child-agent work | App-server starts with both multi-agent controls explicitly disabled. Only the process-level `--subagents true` option enables them; filesystem and web permissions do not. Enabling child agents can increase model usage. |
| Path disclosure | Plaintext logs may contain filesystem paths, login URLs, tokens, prompts, tool payloads, and raw child stderr at any configured level. Unknown-event diagnostics remain bounded by the per-transport method-count cap. Treat all logs as sensitive; HTTP errors still use stable public summaries. |
| Local multi-user state access | On POSIX platforms, continuation directories and files are tightened to `0700` and `0600`, including pre-existing paths. Unsafe state path types fail closed. Windows tests do not infer ACL guarantees from POSIX mode bits. |
| State tampering | Records contain identifiers, bindings, lifecycle state, expiry, usage boundaries, and full pending dynamic-tool call metadata, including arguments. Writes use a private temporary file and atomic rename; malformed records and foreign schema versions are not trusted. |

## Origin policy

The model API rejects every request containing an `Origin` header, even if the value names a loopback URL and even on health routes. Native clients should omit `Origin`. The optional management listener is separate: it requires an administrator session, exact same-origin mutations and CSRF tokens. Adding the console does not relax model API Origin checks.

## Data and diagnostics audit

Required CI is offline and uploads only maintained-source coverage. It does not upload app-server transcripts, login output, continuation state, or live-test diagnostics. Synthetic fixtures use placeholder identifiers, loopback addresses, temporary paths, and `gpt-6-luna`; they contain no captured production requests.

Structured logs are plaintext and intentionally unredacted. Depending on the event, they may include prompts, message bodies, login URLs, credentials or tokens, cwd, tool names/arguments/results, filesystem paths, and raw child stderr. This applies at every log level; keep captures local and short-lived, and never publish or share them without reviewing their full contents. Continuation state does not retain login URLs or authentication tokens.

`--log-level debug` adds bounded unknown-event context and other detail, but lower levels are still sensitive. The opt-in live suite can make model calls and must not publish its output as a CI artifact.

## Review checklist

Before release:

1. Run `npm ci && npm run check` from a clean tree.
2. Confirm protocol regeneration is clean and coverage excludes generated artifacts.
3. Keep runtime log captures out of fixtures and workflow artifacts; use only synthetic placeholders in checked-in diagnostics and review any capture before sharing.
4. Run opt-in live tests only with explicit authorization; state `gpt-6-luna` and the selected hard maximum first: 32 distinct upstream model responses for the core contract, two for the system-prompt contract, or 34 for the full configuration. Count deduplicated `(threadId, responseId)` pairs from `rawResponse/completed` across parent and child threads; fail if child completions cannot be observed.
